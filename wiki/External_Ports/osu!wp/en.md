**Device way**

- Open osu! WP
- Tap "Get Songs"
- Search and select the songs you want to download.
- The songs will be downloaded and can be played after decompression.

**Online Skydrive way** (Requires Microsoft account {``@hotmail/@live``} and file compression { _WinZIP_ })
**Part 1: Making .osz file** (Skip to Part 2 if your selected songs is not in folder form)

- Pick out your songs folders. Copy-Paste to Desktop or any directory you prefer.
  - You can opt to remove StoryBoard elements, ``.osb`` file , Skin, video , (Taiko/CtB/Mania) difficulties to trip down the overall size. Do not do this on original version.
- Compress the folders with preferred file compression software.
- Set Archive format to "ZIP" and rename the file extension from "``.zip``" to "``.osz``"
- Wait for it to complete.
- ``.osz`` file is created.
  - If you are skeptical about it, you can test it on your PC osu! Do note that you will have to redo the "compress" scenario again since the ``.osz`` will change to folder form.

**PC part**

- Connect to Internet and log-in to SkyDrive.
- Upload the ``.osz`` file.
  - Please bear in mind you have 7GB free.
