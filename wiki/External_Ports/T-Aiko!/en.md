## Questions
### Why my profile rank and score did not increase?
- Currently, the only way to increase the rank and score is by playing the beatmap list specified in `Online`;`Daily`
- Playing `Solo` is akin to playing offline, for now.
  - Even if the beatmap is 100% same as the list and gained a new record, it will not be counted towards the profile as long as playing in `Solo`, online or offline.

### I added a new beatmap and T-Aiko! didn't load it
- Did not hit the refresh button at the upper-right of the "Select a Song".
- Placed the beatmap at the wrong beatmap directory or set a wrong beatmap directory. Set the beatmap directory properly and place beatmaps to a proper beatmap directory.
  - Downloads from [osu!MapDownloader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myapp.downloader "osu!MapDownloader") cannot be played by T-Aiko.
- \[Using T-Aiko! Online's DDL\] If the download was interrupted/incomplete and cannot be extracted, there will be a pop-up to notify about it. To rectify this, use file manager to search and delete the bad beatmap file manually. Redownload it after that.

### I have a lot of beatmaps at osu!droid/Songs...
- From Main Menu, press `Options` -> `Song Folder`.
- Modify `mnt/sdcard/T-Aiko/Songs` to `mnt/sdcard/osu!droid/Songs`.
- Return to Main Menu.
- Press T-Aiko application and go to Solo/Online (Song selection). Beatmaps should appear.
  - If new beatmaps did not appear, press the refresh button located at the upper-right screen. It will recompile the beatmaps library.

### Can I use the old T-Aiko/osu!droid account?
**No.**

## Trivia

### History

- T-Aikov2 used to be supported by advertisements until 10/11 March 2017 (2017-03-10/11) update (version 2.4.0), where all the advertisements has been removed.
  - Before that update, the only way to remove the advertisement permanently is by applying for the _Senpai_ upgrade.
  - The advertisement usually pops up once a difficulty was completed and directed to the results screen.
  - There will always be five (5) seconds cooldown time before being allowed to return to the song selection.
  - The advertisement does not pop-up when played offline.
