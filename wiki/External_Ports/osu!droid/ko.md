Introduction
============

**osu!droid** is a port (or a remake) of the original game on the Android platform by [Pesets](http://osu.ppy.sh/u/Pesets). It has been under beta stage for a few months before officially released on Google Play.

Currently, osu!droid is in ver.1.5.10 (15 January 2014). [neico](http://osu.ppy.sh/u/119665) is working on behalf of Pesets's absence. [A different pre-alpha version](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/107611) is in works which may supersede osu!droid (which is currently on hiatus, though).

Adding Beatmaps

-   Open "osu!MapDownloader"
-   Pick your beatmaps and download.
-   Open osu!droid and enjoy.

P.S. It has *many other uses* other than downloading beatmaps for osu!droid only.

**<u>Device way</u>**

-   Open your preferred browser and go to <http://bloodcat.com/osu/>
-   Select your desired beatmap for downloading
-   Change the download directory to "/mnt/sdcard/osu!droid/" (This directory is by default)

-   The beatmap will be imported automatically at the next launch of osu!droid

### Obsolete method

**<u>PC way</u>** (Beatmaps not from bloodcat's website may cause crashes)

-   Connect your device to PC with USB cable
-   The location you should put in now depends on what type the file is.
    -   If you have **<u>.osz or .zip files</u>**, copy them into your device's <u>**osu!droid**</u> directory.
    -   If you have **<u>unpacked songs (i.e. in folders)</u>**, copy them into <u>**osu!droid/Songs**</u> directory.
        -   Directory will vary **if you did modify it in Library-&gt;Beatmap location**, then, **you need to put in that directory you set instead**.
-   Disconnect your device and launch osu!droid

**<u>osu!droid Direct Download (Not suggested, broken)</u>**

-   Click "Get Songs"
-   Pick your beatmap you want to download
-   Wait for the download to complete
-   The beatmap will be imported automatically at the next launch of osu!droid

Gameplay
========

What is the difference?
-----------------------

While theoretically most of the elements of osu! is preserved, some of them (Video and Storyboard) were dropped due to capability of stock RAM (Smartphones ~300MB+/-) and the possible high battery drain. Here's a list of what did not make it into osu!droid:-

-   Video and Storyboard
-   Combo Fire and Combo Burst (Character appearance)
-   [Game Modifiers](Game_Modifiers "wikilink"): Only [Easy](EZ "wikilink"), [No Fail](No_Fail "wikilink"), [Hard Rock](Hard_Rock "wikilink"), [Hidden](Hidden "wikilink"), [Relax](Relax "wikilink"), [Auto Pilot](Auto_Pilot "wikilink") and [Auto](Auto "wikilink"). (2,2,3)
-   Some skin animation (like your lifebar health) may not be as fluid as the original osu!
-   Information (Length, BPM) about the beatmap selected is missing.
-   You can only put one skin on osu!droid as there is no skin selector. osu!default by peppy is used if there is nothing in the Skin folder.
    -   The current version (known as osu! by peppy, art by RBRat3) skin is not used. osu!droid will still use the traditional osu!default by peppy skin.
-   **Beatmaps that are v10 or higher (recently-created beatmaps) are not compatible with osu!droid and might result in unexpected behavior such as crashes and force closes.** (Fixed in Beta ver. only. Not fixed in 1.5.10 yet)

How to install skins
--------------------

<img src="Osu!droid skin.png" title="Osu!droid skin.png" alt="Osu!droid skin.png" width="500" />

-   osu!droid does not have a skin selector. Therefore, if you want to use a skin, you must manually open your wanted skin folder and move all the files into "mnt/sdcard/osu!droid/Skin/"
    -   **It is not suggested to modify the filepath**.

### What elements to remove

-   Fail Background (The fail sound should be kept)
-   Combo Burst
-   Any [Game Modifiers](Game_Modifiers "wikilink") that is not stated in the "What's the difference?"
-   Any .zip or folder contents in the skin. (To save space)
-   Taiko, Catch the Beat, and osu!mania skinning elements (if exist).

Questions
=========

Is there a beatmap specially made for osu!droid?
------------------------------------------------

-   Any beatmap that is made for original osu! is also made for osu!droid. There are no beatmaps created specifically for osu!droid.

I have a lot of beatmaps at T-Aiko!/Songs...
--------------------------------------------

-   From **Main Menu**; press **Options**.
-   Under "**Library**"; press "**Beatmap location**".
-   Modify "**mnt/sdcard/osu!droid/Songs**" to "**mnt/sdcard/T-Aiko!/Songs**".
-   Return to **Main Menu**; press "**Play**". osu!droid should start to process your beatmaps.

Trivia
======

Why did the Auto in osu!droid miss but PC osu! didn't?
------------------------------------------------------

<embed src="Osu!droid_Auto.pngâ€Ž " title="Capability of osu!droid&#39;s Auto. Able to do simultaneous sliders and hit-circles." width="200" />

-   Hardware rendering capability and RAM.
    -   If the hit-object is not rendered in time or screen freeze happened, the screen may "skip" and auto will not be able to hit it (as that hit-object must appear at that specific time frame) and miss will occur.
-   This may happen especially when you set your rendering settings very high and your device may not up to it (especially on intensive parts).

*Fun Fact: Even original osu! Auto may miss on maps that it can perfect combo. This may happen if you are simultaneously using another program (Like Firefox or anything to make your CPU and RAM work more) while leaving osu! in Auto mode. The exception to this if your computer can handle the extra task (like gaming notebook for example) and the beatmap in question has a low Overall Difficulty.*
